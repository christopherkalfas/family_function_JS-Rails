# family_function_JS-Rails

## About

Mod 4 Project for the Flatiron School. Family function is a SPA built on Rails(API), JS, HTML, and CSS. Family Function is designed to act as a virtual family chores list. The app gives households the ability to view the status of all chores(incomplete, complete), as well as the ability to complete,reset, or delete chores.  

## Moviation

For my first fullstack webapp, I tried to think of an idea that actually solves a problem and could be built in a week. A problem I have recently encoutered in my life, was coorinating chores with my partner, Steph. She is in grad school and working while I'm in coding bootcamp. We were having a hard time keeping up with school, keeping up house hold chores and taking care of our two furry little princes. And the cats can't really help with chores.

We got a whiteboard calender for the fridge and it was life changing. Suddenly those chore charts, my mom made me use when I was kid, made sense and familyFunction was born. 

## Code Example

### Custom rendering data of associated model with a Serializer 

#### Create serializer in 'services' folder
![house hold serialer](https://i.ibb.co/QDm5dyt/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-1-08-26-PM.png "")

#### Add new instances of serializer to controller methods 
![house hold controller](https://i.ibb.co/99kXcVd/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-1-18-22-PM.png "")

#### Check server for custom data rendering result
![custom db table](https://i.ibb.co/k58K1QV/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-1-16-18-PM.png "")

Now when a instance of houseHold is fetched the associated chores are useable even though the house doesn't keep track of the chores that BELONG to them.
